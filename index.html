## What is a social network? ##

---

![Social network](assets/social-network-grid.jpg)

---

### Definition ###
***

> a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations) and a set of the dyadic ties between these actors

<br><small>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network</small>

---


### Actors (vertices) ###
***

![Social network](assets/social-network.svg)

> Actors are discrete individual, corporate, or collective social units.

<br><small>Wasserman, Stanley; Faust, Katherine (1994). "Social Network Analysis in the Social and Behavioral Sciences". Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press. pp. 1–27. ISBN 9780521387071</small>

---

### Relations (ties, edges) ###
***

![Dyad](assets/f03.jpg)

A **link** between a pair of actors; constitutes a "dyad".

- **directed** (e.g. *"follower"*) or **undirected**
- **signed** (e.g. *"friend"*) or **unsigned**
- mutual or not

<br><small>https://courseware.e-education.psu.edu/courses/bootcamp/lo09/08.html</small>

---

### Triad ###
***

![Triad](assets/open-triad.jpg)

A group of 3 actors.

- Balance: sign of links
- Transitivity / Network Closure: "the friend of my friend is my friend"

<br><small>http://technosociology.org/?p=693</small>

---

### Centrality ###
***

Identifies the most important (influetial) vertices.

![Centrality](assets/ego_network.png)

<br><small>http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=6526</small>

---

### Degree centrality ###
***

> number of ties a node has

In directed networks there are two types:
- **indegree** : number of ties to the node (followers, popularity)
- **outdegree** : number of ties from the node (following)

![Degree Centrality](assets/degree_centrality.jpg)

<br><small>http://hr.toolbox.com/blogs/organizational-network-mapping/social-organizational-network-analysis-common-terminology-part-3-46734</small>

---

### Betweenness centrality ###
***

number of shortest paths through v / total number of shortest paths

![Betweenness Centrality](assets/betweenness_centrality.png)

- number of times a node acts as a bridge between two nodes
- high betweenness centrality = high influence on the transfer through the network,
assuming transfer follows shortest path

<br><small>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality</small>

---

### Closeness centrality ###
***

The inverse of the sum of the distances from a node to all other nodes.

<br><small>Alex Bavelas. Communication patterns in task-oriented groups. J. Acoust. Soc. Am, 22</small>

---

### Eigenvector centrality ###
***

Eigenvector centrality is a generalization of PageRank.

- measures the influence of a node in a social network
- assigns relative scores to nodes, with nodes of higher scores contributing more than a large number of nodes of lower scores

<br><small>http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-pagerank</small>

---

### Alpha centrality ###
***

Adds *external influence* to eigenvector centrality.

![Alpha Centrality](assets/alpha_centrality.png)

- alpha: a tradeoff constant b/w connection & external influence
 - alpha = 0 : only external influence determines alpha centrality
 - alpha = infinity : alpha centrality = eigenvector centrality

---

### Structural holes ###
***

![Structural Hole](assets/structural_hole.jpg)

- clusters form in networks with homogeneous vertices
- clusters are characterized by strong ties between the vertices
- when two clusters contain non-overlapping information, there is a structural hole between them
- nodes **"bridging"** the structural holes are called **"borkers"** and can leverage **social capital**

## Signed social networks ##
***

Links in social networks can be signed: positive or negative

- Some networks *(eg. Epinions, Slashdot)* allow users to **express link sentiment**
- Voting *("thumbs up" / "thumbs down")* can also indicate sentiment towards users
- Link sign can be **inferred** from surrounding nodes
- Knowing the sign helps **suggest** friends/content
- Signs help predict **influence**

<br><small>J Leskovec, D Huttenlocher, J Kleinberg. Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks, in WWW, 2010</small>

---

### Relation Sign ###
***

A relation in a social network is positive or negative depending on the attitude of the originator towards the target of the relation.


<br><small>J Leskovec, D Huttenlocher, J Kleinberg. Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks, in WWW, 2010</small>

---

### Edge Sign Prediction ###
***
Given a social network, with an edge from node *u* to node *v*, can we infer the sign *s(u,v)* from the rest of the network?

- Estimate unknown sentiment based on other sentiments in the network
 - Similar to link prediction
- Identifying the negative edges in a social network can help predict positive edges, which were not previously known.

<br><small>J Leskovec, D Huttenlocher, J Kleinberg. Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks, in WWW, 2010</small>

---

### Balance Theory ###
***

> my friend’s friend is my friend

> my friend’s enemy is my enemy

> my enemy’s friend is my enemy

> my enemy’s enemy is my friend

Heider’s Balance Theory (1958)

---

### P-O-X model ###
***
Fritz Heider's P-O-X model, also known as a triad.

![Heider's P-O-X model](assets/pox.jpg)

> Sentiment relation p and x is determined by an attitude of p and x toward o. If the
> multiplication of signs of these relations is positive, then the balance state is achieved

<br><small>D Khanafiah , H Situngkir. Social Balance Theory. Revisiting Heider’s Balance Theory for many agents, 2004 </small>
---

### P-O-X model ###
***

- three positive links
- two negatives and one positive

<br><small>D Khanafiah , H Situngkir. Social Balance Theory. Revisiting Heider’s Balance Theory for many agents, 2004 </small>

---

### Status Theory ###
***
![Status Theory](assets/evolution5.jpg)

> Given a **positive**, directed, edge (x,y) from x to y, x regards y as having **higher status**,
> conversly, a **negative** edge indicates that x regards y as having **lower status**.
> Flipping the direction of an edge, also flips its sign.

<br><small>J Leskovec, D Huttenlocher, J Kleinberg. Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks, in WWW, 2010</small>
<br><small>http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.ca/2012/09/jerry-coyne-vs-john-dupre-on-status-of.html</small>

---

### Status Theory ###
***
![Status Theory](assets/status_theory.png)

f status (τ) = s(u, w) + s(w, v).

---

### Balance Theory v.s. Status Theory ###
***

|        | u -> w | w -> v | u -> v  |        | v -> w | w -> u | u -> v  |
| ------ | :----: | :----: | :-----: | ------ | :----: | :----: | :-----: |
| **Balance** | + | + | `+` | **Balance**| + | + | `+` |
| **Status**  | + | + | `+` | **Status** | + | + | `-` |

<br>

Balance Theory assumes undirected graph,

Status Theory assumes directed graph.

---

### Predicting Positive Edges ###
***

Predicting positive edges in signed social networks is useful for recommending content and for making friend suggestions.

![Positive Edges](assets/predicting_positive.png)

- Negative edges can help predict the presence of positive edges.

<br><small>J Leskovec, D Huttenlocher, J Kleinberg. Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks, in WWW, 2010</small>

---

### Influence ###
***

- Information **propagation** indicates **influence**
- Important for *viral marketing*
- **Popularity** and **influence** are *not* strongly correlated
 - having many followers does not mean you can influence them 

<br><small>W Galuba, S Asur, BA Huberman. Influence and passivity in social media, in Machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases, 2011, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</small>

---

### Passivity ###
***

> An average Twitter user retweets only one in 318
> URLs, which is a relatively low value.

How difficult is it to influence a given user?

- Majority of users are **consumers** (i.e. *passive nodes*)
- Barrier to propagation
- Higlhy passive users may be **spammers**

<br><small>W Galuba, S Asur, BA Huberman. Influence and passivity in social media, in Machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases, 2011, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</small>

---

### Influence-Passivity Algorithm ###
***

Directed graph G = (N,E,W); nodes N, arcs E, weights W

- **w** ij : *influence i exerts on j / total influence i attempted to exert on j*
- acceptance rate **u** ij : *influence j accepted from i /  total influence accepted by j*
- rejection rate **v** ji: *influence user i rejected from j / total influence rejected from j*

![Influence Passivity](assets/influence_passivity.png)
<br><small>W Galuba, S Asur, BA Huberman. Influence and passivity in social media, in Machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases, 2011, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</small>

---

### Measure of Influence ###
***

- Number of *followers* (popularity): **weak** predictor
- Number of *retweets*: **poor** predictor of actioning
- Hirsch Index: twitter is *asymmetric*; **poor** predictor
- PageRank: **good** predictor
- IP-Influence score: **best** predictor

<br>Influencing users who are *difficult to influence*, not just many users, has a major effect in social networks.

<br><small>W Galuba, S Asur, BA Huberman. Influence and passivity in social media, in Machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases, 2011, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</small>

---

## Friends ≠ Friends ##
***

- Nodes **interact with few** of their linked nodes
- A dense network **does not imply** large number of interactions
- The network of nodes which **actively interact** with each other is **sparse**
- The sparse network of true friends **indicates influence**

<br><small>BA Huberman, DM Romero, F Wu. Social networks that matter: Twitter under the microscope, inarXiv preprint arXiv:0812.1045, 2008</small>

---

## Manipulating trends ##
***

- *Fake* users are created to increase **popularity**
- Fake users who are *active nodes* can **inflate influence**
- Weibo sample found that fake users (1.08%) are responsible for *49% of total retweets*

<br><small>Louis Yu, SitaramAsur and Bernardo A. Huberman. Artificial Inflation: The Real Story of Trends in SinaWeibo, in arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.0327, 2011</small>

## Viral Marketing ##
***
> a diffusion of information about the product and
> its adoption over the network

- Person-to-person **recommendations**
- Effective for advertising of **niche products**
- **Excessive recommendations** weaken success rate
- Nodes have **influence over few** of their neighbouring nodes
- **Smaller** and **"tightly knit"** clusters are more effective for viral marketing

<br><small>J Leskovec, LA Adamic, BA Huberman. The dynamics of viral marketing, in ACM Transactions on the Web, 2007</small>

---

## Long Tail ##
***

- Online stores offer a large variety of products
- Significant share of purchases is for **rarely sold items**
 - 20%-40% unit sales on Amazon outside of top 100K products
- Niche products are hard to advertise by traditional methods

<br><small>J Leskovec, LA Adamic, BA Huberman. The dynamics of viral marketing, in ACM Transactions on the Web, 2007</small>

---

## Recommendations ##
***

- Collaborative filtering
 - "If you like x, you may also like y"
 - Based on product similarity or user similiratity
-

## Collective wisdom ##
***
Social media predicting the future


- social media can help **forecast** real world performance
- **rate of tweets** can be an indicator of success
- tweets can be used for **sentiment analysis**

<br><small>S. Asur, B. Huberman. Predicting the Future with Social Media, in http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5699, http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/scl/papers/socialmedia/socialmedia.pdf</small>

## Case study ##
***

Social Network Enabled Flue Trends (SNEFT)

- **predicting** a flu epidemic can help contain it
- traditional flu reports offer **delayed** data
- tweets are **real time** and include **location data**
- taken collectively, tweets reveal **underlying patterns**
- number of flu related tweets is **strongly correlated** with upcoming reports
