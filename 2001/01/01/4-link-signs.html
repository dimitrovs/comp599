## Signed social networks
***

Links in social networks can be signed: positive or negative

- Some networks *(eg. Epinions, Slashdot)* allow users to **express link sentiment**
- Voting *("thumbs up" / "thumbs down")* can also indicate sentiment towards users
- Link sign can be **inferred** from surrounding nodes
- Knowing the sign helps **suggest** friends/content
- Signs help predict **influence**

## Influence
***

- Influence is important for *viral marketing*
- Number of **links** from other users affects **popularity**
- Information **propagation** indicates **influence**
- Majority of users are **consumers** (i.e. *passive nodes*)
- **Popularity** and **influence** are *not* strongly correlated

## Manipulating trends
***

- *Fake* users are created to increase **popularity**
- Fake users who are *active nodes* can **inflate influence**
- Weibo sample found that fake users (1.08%) are responsible for *49% of total retweets*

## Friends â‰  Friends
***

- Nodes **interact with few** of their linked nodes
- A dense network **does not imply** large number of interactions
- The network of nodes which **actively interact** with each other is **sparse**
- The sparse network of true friends **indicates influence**

## Viral Marketing
***

- Person-to-person **recommendations**
- Effective for advertising of **niche products**
- **Excessive recommendations** weaken success rate
- Nodes have **influence over few** of their neighbouring nodes
- **Smaller** and **"tightly knit"** clusters are more effective for viral marketing
