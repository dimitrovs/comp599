## Signed social networks ##
***

Links in social networks can be signed: positive or negative

- Some networks *(eg. Epinions, Slashdot)* allow users to **express link sentiment**
- Voting *("thumbs up" / "thumbs down")* can also indicate sentiment towards users
- Link sign can be **inferred** from surrounding nodes
- Knowing the sign helps **suggest** friends/content
- Signs help predict **influence**

### Influence 2 ###
***

A relation in a social network is positive or negative depending on the attitude of the originator towards the target of the relation.

### Edge Sign Prediction ###
***
Given a social network, with an edge from node *u* to node *v*, can we infer the sign *s(u,v)* from the rest of the network?

- Estimate unknown sentiment based on other sentiments in the network
 1. Similar to link prediction

### Influence 4 ###
***

Identifying the negative edges in a social network can help predict positive edges, which were not previously known.

### Balance Theory ###
***

> my friend’s friend is my friend
> my friend’s enemy is my enemy
> my enemy’s friend is my enemy
> my enemy’s enemy is my friend
Heider’s Balance Theory (1958)

### P-O-X model ###
***

![Heider's P-O-X model](assets/pox.jpg)
Fritz Heider's P-O-X model, also known as a triad.

> Sentiment relation p and x is determined by an attitude of p and x toward o. If the
> multiplication of signs of these relations is positive, then the balance state is achieved

- three positive links
- two negatives and one positive

### Status Theory ###
***
![Status Theory](assets/evolution5.jpg)

> Given a **positive**, directed, edge (x,y) from x to y, x regards y as having **higher status**,
> conversly, a **negative** edge indicates that x regards y as having **lower status**.
> Flipping the direction of an edge, also flips its sign.

## Influence ##
***

- Influence is important for *viral marketing*
- Number of **links** from other users affects **popularity**
- Information **propagation** indicates **influence**
- Majority of users are **consumers** (i.e. *passive nodes*)
- **Popularity** and **influence** are *not* strongly correlated
