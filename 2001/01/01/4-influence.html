## Signed social networks ##
***

Links in social networks can be signed: positive or negative

- Some networks *(eg. Epinions, Slashdot)* allow users to **express link sentiment**
- Voting *("thumbs up" / "thumbs down")* can also indicate sentiment towards users
- Link sign can be **inferred** from surrounding nodes
- Knowing the sign helps **suggest** friends/content
- Signs help predict **influence**

### Relation Sign ###
***

A relation in a social network is positive or negative depending on the attitude of the originator towards the target of the relation.

### Edge Sign Prediction ###
***
Given a social network, with an edge from node *u* to node *v*, can we infer the sign *s(u,v)* from the rest of the network?

- Estimate unknown sentiment based on other sentiments in the network
 - Similar to link prediction
- Identifying the negative edges in a social network can help predict positive edges, which were not previously known.

### Balance Theory ###
***

> my friend’s friend is my friend

> my friend’s enemy is my enemy

> my enemy’s friend is my enemy

> my enemy’s enemy is my friend

Heider’s Balance Theory (1958)

### P-O-X model ###
***
Fritz Heider's P-O-X model, also known as a triad.

![Heider's P-O-X model](assets/pox.jpg)

> Sentiment relation p and x is determined by an attitude of p and x toward o. If the
> multiplication of signs of these relations is positive, then the balance state is achieved

### P-O-X model ###
***

- three positive links
- two negatives and one positive

### Status Theory ###
***
![Status Theory](assets/evolution5.jpg)

> Given a **positive**, directed, edge (x,y) from x to y, x regards y as having **higher status**,
> conversly, a **negative** edge indicates that x regards y as having **lower status**.
> Flipping the direction of an edge, also flips its sign.

### Status Theory ###
***
![Status Theory](assets/status_theory.png)

f status (τ) = s(u, w) + s(w, v).

---

### Balance Theory v.s. Status Theory ###
***

|        | u -> w | w -> v | u -> v  |        | v -> w | w -> u | u -> v  |
| ------ | :----: | :----: | :-----: | ------ | :----: | :----: | :-----: |
| **Balance** | + | + | `+` | **Balance**| + | + | `+` |
| **Status**  | + | + | `+` | **Status** | + | + | `-` |

<br>

Balance Theory assumes undirected graph,

Status Theory assumes directed graph.

### Predicting Positive Edges ###
***

Predicting positive edges in signed social networks is useful for recommending content and for making friend suggestions.

![Positive Edges](assets/predicting_positive.png)

- Negative edges can help predict the presence of positive edges.

### Influence ###
***

- Information **propagation** indicates **influence**
- Important for *viral marketing*
- **Popularity** and **influence** are *not* strongly correlated
 - having many followers does not mean you can influence them

### Passivity ###
***

> An average Twitter user retweets only one in 318
> URLs, which is a relatively low value.

How difficult is it to influence a given user?

- Majority of users are **consumers** (i.e. *passive nodes*)
- Barrier to propagation
- Higlhy passive users may be **spammers**

### Influence-Passivity Algorithm ###
***

Directed graph G = (N,E,W); nodes N, arcs E, weights W

- **w** ij : *influence i exerts on j / total influence i attempted to exert on j*
- acceptance rate **u** ij : *influence j accepted from i /  total influence accepted by j*
- rejection rate **v** ji: *influence user i rejected from j / total influence rejected from j*

### Measure of Influence ###
***

- Number of *followers* (popularity): **weak** predictor
- Number of *retweets*: **poor** predictor of actioning
- Hirsch Index: twitter is *asymmetric*; **poor** predictor
- PageRank: **good** predictor
- IP-Influence score: **best** predictor

<br><br>Influencing users who are *difficult to influence*, not just many users, has a major effect in social networks.
