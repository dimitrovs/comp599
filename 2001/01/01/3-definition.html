### Definition ###
***

> a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations) and a set of the dyadic ties between these actors

### Actors (vertices) ###
***

> Actors are discrete individual, corporate, or collective social units.

### Relations (ties, edges) ###
***

![Dyad](assets/f03.jpg)

A **link** between a pair of actors; constitutes a "dyad".

- **directed** (e.g. *"follower"*) or **undirected**
- **signed** (e.g. *"friend"*) or **unsigned**
- mutual or not

### Centrality ###
***

Identifies the most important (influetial) vertices.

---

### Betweenness centrality ###
***

number of shortest paths through v / total number of shortest paths

![Betweenness Centrality](assets/betweenness_centrality.png)

high betweenness centrality = high influence on the transfer through the network,
assuming transfer follows shortest path
