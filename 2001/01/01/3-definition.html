### Definition ###
***

> a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations) and a set of the dyadic ties between these actors

<br><small>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network</small>

### Actors (vertices) ###
***

![Social network](assets/social-network.svg)

> Actors are discrete individual, corporate, or collective social units.

### Relations (ties, edges) ###
***

![Dyad](assets/f03.jpg)

A **link** between a pair of actors; constitutes a "dyad".

- **directed** (e.g. *"follower"*) or **undirected**
- **signed** (e.g. *"friend"*) or **unsigned**
- mutual or not

### Triad ###
***

A group of 3 actors.

- Balance: sign of links
- Transitivity / Network Closure: "the friend of my friend is my friend"

### Centrality ###
***

Identifies the most important (influetial) vertices.

### Degree centrality ###
***

> number of ties a node has

In directed networks there are two types:
- **indegree** : number of ties to the node (followers, popularity)
- **outdegree** : number of ties from the node (following)

### Betweenness centrality ###
***

number of shortest paths through v / total number of shortest paths

![Betweenness Centrality](assets/betweenness_centrality.png)

- number of times a node acts as a bridge between two nodes
- high betweenness centrality = high influence on the transfer through the network,
assuming transfer follows shortest path

---

### Closeness centrality ###
***

The inverse of the sum of the distances from a node to all other nodes.

---

### Eigenvector centrality ###
***

Eigenvector centrality is a generalization of PageRank.

- measures the influence of a node in a social network
- assigns relative scores to nodes, with nodes of higher scores contributing more than a large number of nodes of lower scores

---

### Alpha centrality ###
***

Adds *external influence* to eigenvector centrality.

![Alpha Centrality](assets/alpha_centrality.png)

- alpha: a tradeoff constant b/w connection & external influence
 - alpha = 0 : only external influence determines alpha centrality
 - alpha = infinity : alpha centrality = eigenvector centrality

---

### Structural holes ###
***

![Structural Hole](assets/structural_hole.jpg)

- clusters form in networks with homogeneous vertices
- clusters are characterized by strong ties between the vertices
- when two clusters contain non-overlapping information, there is a structural hole between them
- nodes **"bridging"** the structural holes are called **"borkers"** and can leverage **social capital**
