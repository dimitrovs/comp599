## Signed social networks
***

Links in social networks can be signed: **positive** or **negative** [9].

- Some networks *(eg. Epinions, Slashdot)* allow users to **express link sentiment**
- Voting *("thumbs up" / "thumbs down")* can also indicate sentiment towards users
- Link sign can be **inferred** from surrounding nodes
- Knowing the sign helps **suggest** friends/content
- Signs help analyse **influence**
