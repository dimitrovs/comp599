## Signed social networks


Links in social networks can be signed: **positive** or **negative** [9].

- Some networks (eg. Epinions, Slashdot) allow users to **express link sentiment** <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Voting ("thumbs up" / "thumbs down") can also explicitly state sentiment towards user <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Link sign can be **inferred** from surrounding nodes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Knowing the sign helps **suggest** friends/content
- Signs help analyse **influence**
