## Signed social networks
***

Links in social networks can be signed: positive or negative [9].

- Some networks *(eg. Epinions, Slashdot)* allow users to **express link sentiment**
- Voting *("thumbs up" / "thumbs down")* can also indicate sentiment towards users
- Link sign can be **inferred** from surrounding nodes
- Knowing the sign helps **suggest** friends/content
- Signs help predict **influence**

## Influence
***

- Influence is important for *viral marketing*
- Number of **links** from other users affects **popularity**
- Information **propagation** indicates **influence**
- Majority of users are **consumers** (i.e. *passive nodes*)
- **Popularity** and **influence** are *not* strongly correlated [4]
