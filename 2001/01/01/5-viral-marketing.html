## Viral Marketing ##
***
> a diffusion of information about the product and
> its adoption over the network

- Effective for advertising of **niche products**
- **Excessive recommendations** weaken success rate
- Nodes have **influence over few** of their neighbouring nodes
- **Smaller** and **"tightly knit"** clusters are more effective for viral marketing

## Long Tail ##
***

- Online stores offer a large variety of products
- Significant share of purchases is for **rarely sold items**
 - 20%-40% unit sales on Amazon outside of top 100K products
- Niche products are hard to advertise by traditional methods

## Recommendations ##
***

- **Collaborative filtering**
 - "If you like x, you may also like y"
 - Based on product similarity or user similiratity
 - Product ratings
 - Ratings of others' reviews
- **Person-to-person** recommendations

## Person-to-person ##
***

- stronger moral hazard requires stronger ties to foster information propagation
 - eg. book requires more time to read than DVD, more likely to recommend DVD
- loyal customers more likely to talk to others when dissatisfied
 - not more likely to talk to others when satisfied

## Recommendation Network ##
***

- directed multi graph
 - **nodes**: customers
 - **edges**: recommendations (including direction, product and time)
- forward recommendations
 - when customers purchase as a result of a recommendation, and also decide to recommend to others

## Information Cascades ##
***

- individuals (nodes) make decisions based on the decisions of others
 - when individuals make a purchase and then recommend this can cause a cascade
 - probability of making a recommendation declines after an initial increase, going deeper into the cascade
- each cascade is a network of individuals (nodes) and recommendations (edges)

## Success of Recommendations ##
***

- increasing number of incoming recommendations, increases probability of purchase, up to a point
 - for books after 2 recommendations probability saturates (perceived as SPAM)
 - for DVDs probability staturates at 10 incoming recommendations

---

## Incoming Recommendations ##
***

- receiving too many recommendations (>3) from **the same node** can be perceived as SPAM
- level of saturation also depends on product
 - eg. for books decrease in influence is more gradual than for DVDs
- incentivising too much recommendation weakens the links in a social network

---

## Outgoing Recommendations ##
***

- receiver of recommendation does not know how many other recommendations were sent
- probability of influence as a function of the number of outgoing recommendations depends on product
 - eg. for books, probability increases up to 10 outoging recommendations, then stabalizes or decreases
 - for DVDs, probability increases with the increase of recommendations, i.e. does not plateau
- widely recommended products may not be suitable for Viral Marketing, as multiple individuals will recommend to the same
